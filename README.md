I am currently a Team Leader at a well known DIY store where I have worked for nearly 10 years. It was my weekend job whilst I was at uni which ended up in a promotion and a full-time job offer which I have stuck with ever since! I know this is not my 'forever' job which is why I am finally studying for what I have aspired to be for many years. 
I am completely new to the coding world and I'm currently thoroughly enjoying learning with the help from Code Nation and their 12 week Master Coding bootcamp!
